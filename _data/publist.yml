- title: "On Being In (Autistic) Community"
  image: Paper-Image-Pseudoscience.png
  description: In her book, The Ethics of Autism: Among Them but Not of Them, Deborah Barnbaum suggests that there cannot be a community of autistic persons. This paper demonstrates that the argument Barnbaum forwards in favour of this claim is unsound. More generally, I argue that the approach Barnbaum takes in asserting this claim is representative of the majority of (neurotypical) philosophers theorising about autisticsâ€”an approach which carries with it a significant ethical burden to which philosophers have not been appropriately attuned.
