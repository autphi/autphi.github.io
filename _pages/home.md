<!-- We are a dynamic research group at the [Leiden Institute of Physics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl). Our aim is to explore and understand [quantum materials](http://condensedconcepts.blogspot.nl/2013/05/what-is-quantum-matter.html), including strange metals, high-temperature superconductors, and quantum critical electron matter. -->

<!-- To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)). -->

This research project is currently housed in the Faculty of Arts and Social Science at Dalhousie University.



Philosophy on the Spectrum is supported in part by funding from the [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/home-accueil-eng.aspx).
